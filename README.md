# MeetingWebsite
This GitHub repository contains the project of a meeting website developed during a former internship at Heinrich Heine University. The website was specifically designed for organizing and distributing schedules for group exercises. It provides a user-friendly platform where groups of students can input their availabilities and coordinate schedules for their exercise or study groups.

The main features of this meeting website include:

Capturing group members' availabilities for various time slots.
Automatically generating schedule proposals based on the input availabilities.
Allowing users to confirm, reject, or propose alternative schedule suggestions.
Integrating a clear user interface for easy navigation and usability.
This project was developed using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly frameworks like Bootstrap or jQuery. The backend might have been implemented using frameworks like Flask (Python) or Express (JavaScript), while databases could include MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.

This repository serves not only as an archive for the completed project but also as a resource for future developers dealing with similar projects or looking to extend it. It provides an overview of the code, structure, and functionalities of the meeting website and can serve as a starting point for further enhancements and customizations.
